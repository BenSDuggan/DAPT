# DAPT Testing

Testing for DAP is done using [pytest](pytest.org) and can be installed by entering `pip install -U pytest` in the terminal.  

To run the tests open a python session in the terminal: `python3`.  Then type:
```
	import dapt
	dapt.test()
```

You should now see all the tests run sucessfully.
