.. _base-storage:

This module contans classes and functions that assist with the storage APIs.  It includes the Storage class and methods to deal with overwriting files/folders.

Because the APIs of services are all different, DAPT calls the resource identification a ``file_id``.  Even if the resource is not a file, it is called a ``file_id``.  This is similar to everything is a file in Linux.

To attempt to make paths easier to navigate, the download and upload methods include a ``folder`` and ``name`` attribute.  So if you wanted to upload a file in ``foo/bar/file.py``, you would set ``folder`` to ``foo/bar`` and ``name`` to ``file.py``.  You can omit the ``folder`` attribute and the current directory will be used.  The motivation for this is to 1) make the file name and save location explicit, and 2) standardize these variables accross the download and upload functions.  When downloading a resource, you may want to keep the file name from the service, or rename it.  By setting the ``name`` attribute to ``None``, the name of the resource will be used.

    Storage base
    ============

    The Storage class is designed to provide a standard interface for adding APIs that enable storage.  This class defines the basic required functions that must be implimented for two classes inheriting this class to work in the same workflow, assuming the correct API keys are used.  Switching storage objects should work seemlessly, if a Config object is used to initialize the Storage object.  If the API credentials are folderectly provided, this cannot be guarantied because different services had different methods of initialization.

    Different APIs might have different methods for identifying files.  For example, Box uses IDs for files and folders, but another service might use a path from the root folderectory.  The method of identifying files or folders is called a ``fid`` (file/folder identification) in DAPT.  Different implimentations might use different protocols for files and folders, so the Storage methods should take care of this.

    Required methods
    ----------------

    There are four required methods that all Storage objects must implement.  The required methods are download, delete, rename, and upload.  These methods are based off REST APIs, although the underlying implimentation do not need to use REST.
