Storage base
============

.. _storage-class:

    The Storage class is designed to provide a standard interface for adding APIs that enable
    storage.  This class defines the basic required functions that must be implimented for two
    classes inheriting this class to work in the same workflow, assuming the correct API keys
    are used.  Switching storage objects should work seemlessly, if a Config object is used to
    initialize the Storage object.  If the API credentials are folderectly provided, this cannot
    be guarantied because different services had different methods of initialization.

    Different APIs might have different methods for identifying files.  For example, Box uses IDs
    for files and folders, but another service might use a path from the root directory.  The
    method of identifying files or folders is called a ``fid`` (file/folder identification) in
    DAPT.  Different implimentations might use different protocols for files and folders, so the
    Storage methods should take care of this.

    .. _base-storage-required:

    Required methods
    ----------------

    There are four required methods that all Storage objects must implement.  The required
    methods are download, delete, rename, and upload.  These methods are based off REST APIs,
    although the underlying implimentation do not need to use REST.
