Examples
========

Examples of DAPT are kept in the `examples <https://github.com/BenSDuggan/DAPT/examples>`_ folder.  There are basic examples of the main features of DAPT including using a delimited file, Google Sheets and Box.  There is also an example of how DAPT can be used with `PhysiCell <https://github.com/MathCancer/PhysiCell>`_.  It is recommended that you start with the `csv_example.py <https://github.com/BenSDuggan/DAPT/examples/csv_example.py>`_ script as it is the simplest to use and only requires DAPT to be installed.  The other scripts require API keys to be generated.
